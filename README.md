# Introduction
Thank you for taking the time to do the coding challenge. The goal of the challenge is to asses your level of engineering seniority.<br/>
The base challenge should take you 2 hours, but we would like to encourage you to spend more time on it so we can better assess your level.

# What would we like to see
The coding challenge will test your skills to convert functional requirements into a technical solution, taking into account things that are not explicitely mentioned (just like a real life situation where the stakeholder does not exactly know what he/she wants).<br/><br/>

Furthermore, we expect you to write the solution in such a way that you are proud of the code. It should be ready to go out to production and the code should be in such a state that it can be shared with other developers to be worked on. Think about general software engineering practices, patterns and code refactoring techniques.<br/><br/>

It is important to note that we would like to see different skills. We don't want you to waste time on repetive tasks. If you have proven that you can do it once or twice time, we know you can do it multiple times (Just make sure you mention it with a comment in the code why you didn't do it. This shows that you have thought about it). 

# The code
This repository contains a simple web API that has some endpoints that are not (fully) implemented. You are free to do anything you like to the solution, except for changing the contracts and endpoints of the API (as we will be running some automated tests). <br/><br/>

Additionally, we have added some comments in the code indicating bugs or small challenge we would like to solve. Please leave the comment, but you can do anything underneath it to solve the bug. Additionally, please provide what you think the problem was and why you think your change solved it.<br/><br/>

Example: <br/>
"// TODO-001: Challenge: Something is wrong with this code. What is it and how can you solve it"<br/>
"// Answer: We are looping over the same array twice, while we could have done it once. Looping over it twice is negletable, but still, looping once is faster."

# Functional requirements
TODO

# Steps
1. Analyze the functional requirements
2. Analyze the existing code
3. Come up with an idea on how you want to structure your code (again, as long as the endpoints and contracts remain the same, you can do anything)
4. Implement a solution that will satisfy the functional requirements
5. Search for all "// TODO" in the code and solve them
6. Provide a document to describe:
    1. Anything that you thinks needs clarifications on the provided solution.
    2. Anything that you would have done if you have more time.
